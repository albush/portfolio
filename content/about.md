I help connect people with the information they need to make awesome things in the cloud. I enjoy creating new teams. I recently helped build the Technical Community Manager team at Rackspace. I also was a founding member & architect of Rackspace's Cloud Launch Team.

During my time on the Launch Team, I helped more than 100 new cloud consumers get started with cloud hosting, developed a weekly live video show - [Office Hours Hangouts][3], was one of the first 175 Rackers to become certified "Cloud Savvy," and was awarded the [Fanatical Jacket, Rackspace's highest honor][2] for outstanding customer support.

Before Rackspace, I helped create the [Stevie Award winning](http://www.centraldesktop.com/press-releases?id=68) onboarding program for cloud collaboration suite Central Desktop, where I worked directly with companies and organizations like MLB.com, Sesame Workshop, and IEEE. When I'm not helping customers learn how to build awesome things in the cloud, I can be found performing improv comedy with [ComedySportz San Antonio][1], or dreaming up new styles for my award-winning mustache.
