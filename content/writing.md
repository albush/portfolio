## My Blog

My personal blog has morphed a bit through the years. Recently, I've been writing helpful tips for my friends and family. I try to find a way to document and capture the things that I think will help others.

* [How to make Outlook for Mac act like Google Inbox](http://albush.com/post/how-to-make-outlook-act-like-google-inbox/) - I use Inbox by Google for my personal email, but I used Outlook for Mac at work. I wanted to replicate some of the useful features of Inbox in Outlook. I found a way to make a few of them work, then shared my secrets with anyone else who might be interested.
* [Slack is the amplifier, not the problem](http://albush.com/post/ditch-your-behavior-not-your-slack-channel/) - In response to a lively social media discussion, I collected my thoughts on behavioral vs technical issues with the popular communications app, Slack.

## Rackspace Blog

I [wrote more than 50 posts for the Rackspace blog](https://blog.rackspace.com/author/alan-bush) over my almost 5 years with the company, all on a volunteer basis. The unofficial motto of the Community and Social teams was "#BeHelpful." I found I could best be helpful by writing down what worked for other customers, sharing it with a larger audience.

* [Tips To Steer Your Startup To SXSW Success](https://blog.rackspace.com/tips-to-prepare-your-app-for-sxsw) - My first piece for Rackspace. In March of 2013, there were few events that would throw as much traffic at your startup's app as South by Southwest. I wrote Rackspace's guide to surviving that spike.
* [How O’Reilly Media Uses Containers – An Office Hours Hangout Recap](https://blog.rackspace.com/how-oreilly-media-uses-containers-an-office-hours-hangout-recap) - I conducted many customer interviews, including this one with Andrew Odewahn, CTO at O'Reilly Media.

## Rackspace Community

As a Community Manager at Rackspace, I took a proactive approach to our customer success content. Many of the guides and resources I created were intended for our newest customers. My firm belief is that the first few weeks with a new customer determine how long they'll be a customer, and so much of my content was written to help get the newest customers ready for success.

* [Rackspace Cloud Getting Started Guide](https://community.rackspace.com/products/f/54/t/5291) - A collection of best practices for the newest customers.
* [Tips for a Successful Migration to Rackspace](https://community.rackspace.com/products/f/54/t/4687) - Most of our customers were switching existing projects from another host. This 2 part guide helped not only new customers, but also prospective customers, feel confident in migrating their applications to Rackspace.

## Beer Reviews

I've been known to enjoy a tasty beverage or two, and recently San Antonio Flavor has given me the opportunity to share reviews for local craft beers. A few of my favorites:

* [Freetail’s Oktoberfiesta: South TX Take on a Classic German Beer](http://www.saflavor.com/freetails-oktoberfiesta-south-tx-take-on-a-classic-german-beer/)
* [Ranger Creek San Antonio Lager: Ode to SA in a Can](http://www.saflavor.com/ranger-creek-san-antonio-lager/)
* [Branchline Brewing’s Silver and Black IPA: San Antonio Beers](http://www.saflavor.com/branchline-brewings-silver-and-black-ipa-san-antonio-beers/)
